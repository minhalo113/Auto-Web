Queen Elizabeth I, also known as the Virgin Queen, was known for her remarkable beauty and poise. However, she suffered from a severe bout of smallpox in her youth, which left lasting scars on her face. In an effort to conceal these scars, the queen became obsessed with wearing makeup and spent years perfecting her beauty regimen.

Her makeup included a heavy white lead-based foundation, which was highly toxic and caused serious skin damage over time. The Mercury-based red lipstick she applied accentuated her lips, but also presented serious health risks. Inhaling or ingesting Mercury, the key ingredient in her lipstick, caused tremors, paranoia, and even hallucinations.

The queen's strict makeup routine undoubtedly took years off her life. The white lead in the foundation, mixed with other chemicals like vinegar, caused serious side effects such as itching, swelling, and acne flare-ups. Moreover, the Mercury in the lipstick caused severe dental problems such as gum disease, tooth loss, and blackening of teeth.

Despite these health concerns, Elizabeth I remained devoted to her beauty routine. In fact, her love for cosmetics became so extreme that she banned all other ladies of the court from wearing makeup except for herself and her ladies-in-waiting.

Ironically, Elizabeth I, who spent her life in pursuit of beauty, remains one of the most celebrated figures in British history for her intellect, strength, and independence. Her legacy serves as a powerful reminder that true beauty can come from within, rather than superficial embellishments.
